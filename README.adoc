= Avoid the JAR hell with Java 9

- Make sure that you have disabled the gradle daemon.
- Build everything and run the app with `./gradlew run` .
- The output will show that 2 versions of the same module have been loaded at the same time:

    Greetings from version TWO!
    Greetings from version ONE!

== Some background

The directories hello1 and hello2 contain almost the same code with just some small modification in the run() method. It
simulates loading 2 different versions of the same module. This would be impossible to use both JARs in the same
classpath. But it is possible to work around that limitation by constructing 2 Layer instances. That is what main code in
link:src/main/java/com/app/Main.java[Main.java] is doing.
